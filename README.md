# Learned HeyFusion

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the open-source software and hardware associated with our article. This repository provides all the necessary code, designs, and documentation to reproduce the results and experiments described in our paper.

## About the Project

In this study, we introduce a novel shared-control system for key-hole docking operations, combining a commercial camera with occlusion-robust pose estimation and a hand-eye information fusion technique. This system is used to enhance docking precision and force-compliance safety. To train a hand-eye information fusion network model, we generated a self-supervised dataset using this docking system. After training, our pose estimation method showed improved accuracy compared to traditional methods, including observation-only approaches, hand-eye calibration, and conventional state estimation filters. In real-world phantom experiments, our approach demonstrated its effectiveness with reduced position dispersion (1.23± 0.81 mm vs. 2.47 ± 1.22 mm) and force dispersion (0.78± 0.57 N vs. 1.15 ± 0.97 N) compared to the control group. These advancements in semi-autonomy co-manipulation scenarios enhance interaction and stability. The study presents an anti-interference, steady, and precision solution with potential applications extending beyond laparoscopic surgery to other minimally invasive procedures.
